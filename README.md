## 📍 Overview

**Expense Tracker Pro** is a lightweight, serverless financial management tool designed to help users track their spending habits. Unlike simple list-based trackers, this application integrates **Chart.js** to provide real-time visual analytics of your income versus expenses.

Data is persisted using the browser's **Local Storage**, ensuring your financial data remains private and available even after refreshing the page.
